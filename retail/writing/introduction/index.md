<br>56 Disgruntled Street
<br>Somewhere Unhappy
<br>1AM MAD
 
<br>Customer Service Manager
<br>That Awful Company
<br>Somewhere Awful
<br>UR BAD
<br>June 15, 2008
 
<br>Dear Sir/Madam,

<br>I am writing this letter to complain about the poor service I received from your company on June 12, 2015. I was visited by a spokesman of Philips Enterprise, Mr. Klaassen, at my home.

<br>Mr. Klaassen arrived one hour late for his appointment and gave no apology  for this. Your employee did not took off his muddy shoes when he entered my house, and by not doing this he left dirt in the hallway. Mr. Klaassen then continued to talk about a range of products to me in which I was not interested. 

<br>I tried to ask your employee a couple of times about the products in which I was interested, but he refused to answer my questions. We ended our meeting after twenty-five minutes without closing a deal for a product.

<br>I am very annoyed that I wasted a morning (and half a day's vacation) waiting for Mr. Klaassen to show up. My impression of Philips Enterprise has badly influenced,  and I am very concerned about how my own business is being managed by your firm. Furthermore, Mr. Klaassenâ€™s mistake with his shoes has made me to contact a cleaning service to remove the dirt off my carpet in the hallway.


<br>I believe this is not the way Philips Enterprice wants to do business with his customers. I have been with you since the company was founded and have never had any problems like this before. I would really like to discuss this problem with you to prevent this to happen again in the future. 

<br>I look forward to hearing from you.

<br>Yours faithfully,
 

<br>Signature
 
<br>George Baker
