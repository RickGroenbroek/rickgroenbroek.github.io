This site was created by Rick Groenbroek and Frank Uijtendaal. Both studying at the NHL Hogeschool in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. As teachers to be we have always been figuring out what the best way, for us, is to teach English to Dutch students. There are many ways to teach, standing in front of the classroom, or perhaps making the students work on their own. A new and popular way is Project/Task Based Learning. That is what this website is about.
