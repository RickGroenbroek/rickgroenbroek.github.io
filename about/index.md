About task-based language teaching:

<p>Task-Based Language teaching,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the course of years Task-Based Language teaching has become more and more interesting. Teachers all over the world have grasped this new idea and developed it in their own way. But what is Task-based teaching? Williams and Burden (1997:168), tell us: "A task is any activity that learners engage in to a process of learning a language." Basically, task-based teaching is an approach which offers students opportunities to actively engage in communication in order to achieve a goal or complete a task. TBL seeks to develop students' interlanguage through providing a task and then using language to solve it. Our tasks, projects and webquests provide an enviroment to do just that. Helping students to achieve a goal, complete a task, to learn something which they can use in their lives. <br>- F. Uijtendaal & R. Groenbroek </p>

About us:
<br>This site was created by Rick Groenbroek and Frank Uijtendaal. Both studying at the NHL Hogeschool in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. As teachers to be we have always been figuring out what the best way, for us, is to teach English to Dutch students. There are many ways to teach, standing in front of the classroom, or perhaps making the students work on their own. A new and popular way is Project/Task Based Learning. That's what this website is about.
