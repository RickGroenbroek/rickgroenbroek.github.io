Travelling. Going around the world. By bike, plane, car or train, anything is possible. A lot of people love to travel, but there are some who don't like it at all. Modern day technology brought the outside world to your doorstep. What about you? Do you like to travel? How would you like to travel?

Assignment one:  create a mindmap about everything that you can think of that has to do with travelling! You can use paint, word, or a website like mindmeister. Create the mindmap and send it to your teacher. Don't forget to add your name and class!
