"There's a process for everything, and for everything there's a process"

Here you will find the text which you have to read. After the text there will be a set of questions. We don't know whether there will be questions on the page, or in a separate file. Perhaps both, so that the students can put the answers on the separate sheet provided, which can and will be e-mailed to the teacher.

We should make a format for the questions, including spaces for answers, name, date and class.





<div style="float: left"> 
<a href="{{ site.url }}/webquest/commerce/webquest-1/task-1/" class="btn">Go back to task</a>
</div>

<div style="float: right"> 
<a href="{{ site.url }}/webquest/commerce/webquest-1/evaluation-1/" class="btn">Go to evaluation</a>
</div>
